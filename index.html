  <h2>Join TRU5</h2>
  <p>TRU5 is an AI-native community built on Solana with a mission to outlast the hype, reject the larps, and set a new standard for what real innovation looks like in Web3. We aren't here to chase narratives — we are here to build infrastructure, connections, and tools that survive market cycles.</p>
  <p>As fake AI tokens flood the space with no vision and no future, TRU5 grows stronger. Every new real member makes our network smarter, tougher, and more resilient. Every fake project that fades only proves why TRU5 matters.</p>
  <p>TRU5 is a movement for real builders, real believers, and real communities. No fake hype. No mercy for larpers. We are growing block by block, wallet by wallet, idea by idea — forging the future of AI on Solana and beyond.</p>
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>Build a community too real to fail. Launch tools that filter truth from noise. Create an ecosystem where credibility is currency and real innovation wins.</p>
  <p>TRU5 is not a moment. TRU5 is a machine.</p>
